# YouTube Landing Page Clone

This project is a **YouTube Clone Landing Page**, built using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. It is designed as a practice project to showcase my skills in front-end web development. The page mimics the basic layout and design of YouTube's homepage, providing an intuitive experience that closely mirrors the actual platform's landing page.

## 🌟 Project Features

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts the layout to various screen sizes including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Video Grid Layout:** A grid of videos with thumbnail previews and essential details like titles and video length.
* **YouTube-like Interface:** Includes a navigation bar, footer, and side panel mimicking YouTube's design structure.
* **No JavaScript:** This project uses only **HTML** and **CSS**, focusing purely on layout and styling.

## 💻 Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: Used for building the structure of the webpage.
* **CSS3**: Used for styling the page, including Flexbox for layout and responsive design.
* **Responsive Web Design**: Ensuring the page is optimized for various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
